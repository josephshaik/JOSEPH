IOT Types:
There are two types of IoT: CIoT and IIoT
CIoT often focuses on convenience for individual customers, whereas IIoT is strongly focused on the industry sector, improving the efficiency, security, and output of operations with a focus on Return on Investment (ROI).
Industrial Internet Of Things
Industry + Internet + Things = Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)

The IIoT represents industry-oriented applications where:

● Devices are gadgets functioning in industrial, transportation, energy, or medical environment.

● Data quantity and rates tend to vary from sustained to relatively high.

● Applications are safety-critical, for example, the misbehaving of a smart traffic system can threaten drivers.

● IIoT applications tend to be system-centric.
Consumer + Internet + Things = Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT)

The CIoT is a category of consumer-oriented applications where:

● Gadgets are consumer devices, for example, mobile, refrigerator, glasses, etc.

● Data quantity and rates are comparatively low.

● Applications are not very critical, for example, failure of fitness gadgets will not harm you.

● CIoT applications are consumer-centric.
General use of IOT:
1. Wearables.
2. Health
3. Traffic monitoring.
4. Fleet management
5. Agriculture.
6. Hospitality.
7. Smart grid and energy saving.
8. Water supply.
9. Maintenance management.
